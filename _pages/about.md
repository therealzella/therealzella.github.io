About Me
------
I am currently a research assistant in the **Department of Computer Science** at **North Carolina State University**, advised by **Dr. Huining Li**. Previously, I earned my **M.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering** from **Duke University** and my **B.S. in Information Sciences** from the **University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign**. My research focuses on **AI for healthcare**, with interests in **human-centered AI**, **multimodal large language models**, and methods that connect **language and physiological signals** (e.g., speech, PPG/ECG). I’m currently working on voice-based biomarkers for early dementia screening and signal-to-signal modeling for mobile health monitoring, aiming to build reliable, interpretable systems with clinical impact.

**Current directions**
- **AI for Healthcare (NCSU):** Voice-based biomarkers for early dementia screening and PPG→ECG signal modeling for mobile health monitoring.
- **Computational Social Science / AI for Social Good (with NCSA collaborators):** Prior work analyzing societal impact in large-scale text datasets (e.g., scientific media), leading to peer-reviewed outputs.
- **Multimodal LLMs:** Building and evaluating human-centered multimodal systems that connect text, audio, and biosignals.

For more details, see my [Publications](/publications/) and [CV](/files/Zella_Zhao_CV.pdf).


**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
