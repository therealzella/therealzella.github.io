About Me
------
I am currently a research assistant in the Department of Computer Science at North Carolina State University, advised by Dr. Huining Li. Previously, I earned my M.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering from Duke University and my B.S. in Information Sciences from the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign. My research focuses on AI for healthcare, human-centered AI / AI for social good, multimodal large language models. I’m currently working on voice-based biomarkers for early dementia screening and signal-to-signal modeling for mobile health monitoring, aiming to build reliable, interpretable systems with clinical impact.

**Current directions**
- **AI for Healthcare (NCSU):** Voice-based biomarkers for early dementia screening and PPG→ECG signal modeling for mobile health monitoring.
- **Computational Social Science / AI for Social Good (with NCSA collaborators):** Prior work analyzing societal impact in large-scale text datasets (e.g., scientific media), leading to peer-reviewed outputs.
- **Multimodal LLMs:** Building and evaluating human-centered multimodal systems that connect text, audio, and biosignals.

For more details, see my [Publications](/publications/) and [CV](/files/Zella_Zhao_CV.pdf).
